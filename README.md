# Market Basket Analysis using R

## Overview
This project performs Market Basket Analysis using association rule mining with the **`arules`** and **`arulesViz`** packages in R. The analysis identifies frequent itemsets and generates association rules based on a transactional dataset.

## Features
- Loading and preprocessing transactional data.
- Mining frequent itemsets using the Apriori algorithm.
- Generating association rules.
- Visualizing frequent itemsets and association rules.

## Prerequisites
- R version 4.4.2 or later.
- Required R packages:
  - `arules`
  - `arulesViz`

To install the required packages, run the following commands in your R console:
```R
install.packages("arules")
install.packages("arulesViz")
```

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project is a transactional dataset in CSV format. Ensure that the dataset (Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv) is placed in the correct directory for loading.
- The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Market Basket Optimization Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devchauhan1/market-basket-optimisationcsv?resource=download).
- This dataset is used under the terms and conditions specified by Kaggle and the dataset's original creators. Make sure to comply with the datasetâ€™s license when using it.
  
## Usage
- Load the dataset using the read.transactions function from the arules package.
- Preprocess the data (e.g., removing duplicates or irrelevant items).
- Use the apriori function to find frequent itemsets.
- Generate association rules using the ruleInduction function.
- Visualize the results using the arulesViz package.
