- Mining frequent itemsets using the Apriori algorithm.
- Generating association rules.
- Visualizing frequent itemsets and association rules.

## Prerequisites

- Required R packages:
  - `arules`
  - `arulesViz`

To install the required packages, run the following commands in your R console:
```R
